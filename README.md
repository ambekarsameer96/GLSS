# Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of NIR Images through Generative Latent Search
Tensrflow Implementation of our method  to transfer the bias from the source to the target domain. The latent space of a generative model, learnt on the source domain, is employed to find the "clones" for the target samples. As the "clones" are sampled from the source distribution, an oracle segmentation model learnt only on source, will interpret these "clones" of target samples in a better way, thereby reducing the domain shift. The proposed method guarantees to reduce the shift.
